**#🌿 Green Habit Tracker – Digital Diary for Climate Action**
🌱 “Track your green actions. See your impact. Build a better planet.”
A sustainability-focused digital tool built to promote eco-conscious behavior through habit tracking, impact visualization, and community motivation — created under the 1M1B Future Leaders Program.

##**🧭 Project Overview**
Many people want to reduce their carbon footprint by adopting green habits — like using public transport, carrying reusable bags, or eating plant-based meals. But without a system to log, track, and stay motivated, these habits often fade away.

This project offers a solution in the form of a web app that acts as a personal green habit tracker. It makes sustainability measurable, motivating, and even fun!

✅ Core Features
🌍 Daily Habit Logging
Log eco-friendly actions like skipping plastic, turning off unused lights, or eating vegetarian meals.

📊 Real-Time Impact Calculation
Each action shows real-time savings in CO₂, water, or waste — backed by verified data sources (UNEP, EPA, India’s Green Census).

📈 Progress Visualization
Track your streaks, view weekly/monthly savings, and build your personal sustainability graph.

🏅 Gamification Layer
Earn digital badges, collect impact points, and share your achievements on social media to inspire others.

🤝 Peer Motivation & Sharing
Invite friends, form groups, and participate in green habit challenges together.

💡 Innovation & Impact
This tool empowers users with awareness + action, bridging the gap between intention and habit. With enough users, the tracker could:

Support green campuses and corporates in ESG reporting

Encourage youth competitions or pledges

Enable municipal or school-level sustainability dashboards
