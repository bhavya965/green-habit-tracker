## **🌿 Green Habit Tracker – Digital Diary for Climate Action**

“Track your green actions. See your impact. Build a better planet.”

The Green Habit Tracker is a digital tool designed to help individuals adopt and maintain eco-friendly habits by tracking their actions, calculating their environmental impact, and encouraging sustained behavior change through motivation and gamification.

This project was created under the 1M1B Future Leaders Program by a passionate team aiming to promote sustainability in everyday life.

Log daily green habits (like carrying a reusable bottle or skipping plastic)

Track their CO₂, water, and waste savings in real-time

View their progress through simple charts and streaks

Stay motivated with badges, impact cards, and peer invitations
